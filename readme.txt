Hei, dette programmet heter colors
den gir brukeren en farge angående inputen den fikk


        // output by the programm (saying hello and ask if you are ready to find your color)
        // input by the user ('ja' eller 'nei')

        // if = 'nei' will the program close

        // if else = 'ja' will the programm continue

        // else = if the user write someting exept 'ja' or 'nei' will the program repeat the first output

        // output: here will it ask the name of the user
        // input: here will the user write down the name

        // output: here will it ask how old the user is
        // input: here will the user write down how old the user is

        // if: is the age under 16 it will say the user is not old enough
        // if else: it will continue the program

        //output: here will the programm ask where the user lives
        //input: here will the write down the answer

        //here will the user be set into an color depends on what input the program got
